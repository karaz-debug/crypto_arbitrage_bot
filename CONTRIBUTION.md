# Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Bot

## Project Overview

The Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Bot is an automated trading system designed to identify and exploit price discrepancies for cryptocurrencies across multiple exchanges. It monitors real-time price data, calculates potential arbitrage opportunities, and executes trades to capitalize on profitable scenarios.

## Key Features

- Multi-exchange support
- Real-time data fetching
- Automated arbitrage detection and trading
- Robust error handling and risk management
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Scalable and secure design

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: ccxt, pandas, NumPy, python-dotenv, logging
- Testing: unittest, pytest
