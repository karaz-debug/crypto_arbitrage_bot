## Project Overview 
 - The Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Bot is designed to identify and exploit price differences for the same cryptocurrency across multiple exchanges (e.g., Binance, Kraken). The bot continuously tracks real-time prices, calculates potential arbitrage opportunities considering fees and transfer times, and executes trades automatically when profitable conditions are met.

## Key Objectives:

 - Data Acquisition: Fetch real-time price data from multiple exchanges.
Arbitrage Detection: Identify price spreads that present profitable  = - - - opportunities.
 - Automated Execution: Place buy/sell orders across exchanges efficiently.
 - Risk Management: Handle errors, transfer delays, and ensure liquidity.
 - Performance Tracking: Log trades and calculate net profits.
